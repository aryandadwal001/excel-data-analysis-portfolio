## üîë Key Excel Concepts Demonstrated

This workbook applies a comprehensive set of logical operations to transform raw data into actionable business decisions.

| Excel Function | Project Application | Outcome / Data Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IF** | Determines the basic status based on a single condition (e.g., did they hit the revenue goal?). | `Met Target` or `Below Target` Status |
| **Nested IF** | Assigns granular performance grades based on multiple thresholds. | `Excellent` / `Good` / `Average` / `Poor` Grade |
| **AND** | Checks bonus eligibility‚Äîall mandatory criteria must be true. | Bonus Eligibility Status (Must meet **ALL** criteria) |
| **OR** | Awards special recognition if an employee meets at least one specific high-level goal. | Special Recognition Status (Meets **ANY** criteria) |
| **NOT** | Flags individuals who do *not* meet a minimum, mandatory improvement standard. | `Needs Improvement` Flag |
| **IFS** | Calculates tiered, conditional bonus amounts efficiently without nesting. | Variable Bonus Payout ($) |
| **IFERROR** | Ensures commission rate calculations do not break if a prerequisite value is zero. | Error-Protected Commission Rate Calculation |

## üìä Analysis Highlights

* **Automated Grading:** Performance grades are instantly assigned based on a complex Nested IF structure.
* **Tiered Bonus:** The `IFS` function provides a clean, scalable method for calculating variable payouts.
* **Eligibility Gates:** The `AND` and `OR` functions clearly define the multiple, complex paths to receiving incentives.
* **Robust Error Handling:** The use of `IFERROR` demonstrates a focus on producing clean, reliable reports.
