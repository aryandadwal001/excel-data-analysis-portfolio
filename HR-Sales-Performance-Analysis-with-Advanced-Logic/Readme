# üìà HR/Sales Performance Analysis with Advanced Excel Logic

This project demonstrates proficiency in using advanced logical functions in Microsoft Excel for comprehensive data analysis, specifically applied to an employee performance and bonus scenario.

The analysis evaluates employee performance metrics, calculates eligibility, assigns grades, and determines tiered bonus structures, all while ensuring error-free calculations.

## üîë Key Excel Concepts Demonstrated

This workbook applies **seven** fundamental and advanced logical operations to derive meaningful insights and automated decision-making from the raw data.

| Function | Purpose in Project | Data Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IF** | Determines the basic status based on a single condition. | `Met Target` / `Below Target` Status |
| **Nested IF** | Assigns granular performance grades based on multiple conditions. | `Excellent` / `Good` / `Average` / `Poor` Grades |
| **AND** | Checks multiple criteria to confirm eligibility for a bonus. | Bonus Eligibility (must meet **ALL** criteria) |
| **OR** | Awards special recognition if an employee meets at least one specific goal. | Special Recognition Status (meets **ANY** criteria) |
| **NOT** | Flags individuals who do *not* meet a minimum standard. | `Needs Improvement` Flag |
| **IFS** | Calculates tiered, conditional bonus payouts based on specific performance levels. | Variable Bonus Amount ($) |
| **IFERROR** | Ensures commission rate calculations do not result in errors (e.g., Division by Zero). | Error-Protected Commission Rate |

## üìä Data & Analysis Highlights

* **Performance Grading:** Automated assignment of performance grades based on predefined metrics.
* **Bonus Calculation:** Tiered bonus structures are dynamically calculated using the powerful `IFS` function.
* **Error Handling:** Robust handling of potential division by zero errors in the commission calculation column.
* **Clarity:** The use of distinct logical functions makes the decision-making process within the data transparent and auditable.
